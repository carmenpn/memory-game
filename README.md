## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play

Press any card you want.

The timer will start recording the duration of your game. 
Your moves will be counted. 
You receive more stars if you match all cards with fewer moves.

Once you have finished the game, a pop-up window will appear, detailing your performance.
You can choose either to begin another game... or begin another game.

Enjoy!
