# Memory Game Project

A memory game project where your memory will be put to the test. 
Match any pair of cards and be the winner!

## How to play

Press any card you want.

The timer will start recording the duration of your game. 
Your moves will be counted. 
You receive more stars if you match all cards with fewer moves.

Once you have finished the game, a pop-up window will appear, detailing your performance.
You can choose either to begin another game... or begin another game.

Enjoy!
